Hi! I'm Mike Burkhart - IT veteran of 20+ years, focused on customer-centric delivery, simplifying and demystifying the complexity of hybrid / multi / (please don't let this stick) super-cloud, as well as helping customers through their DevOps journey, and breaking down barriers to success.

You probably got here because you saw a presentation I gave, or a post I made on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeburkhart/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vmikeb). I am truly grateful for your time and attention in this regard, as I do not monetize this blog at all.

### Hobbies, Projects, and more errata

More to come, currently my hobby is revamping this website, which is also a quite a project!

### Contact me

...on Twitter or LinkedIn please, I'm still rewiring everything :)
