Hi! I'm Mike Burkhart - IT veteran of 20+ years, focused on customer-centric delivery. Those are $5 words for me being passionate about business outcomes and not "selling the vision" and then screwing people over. No really, it's great, everyone should try it. 

You probably got here because you saw a presentation I gave, or a post I made on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeburkhart/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vmikeb). I am truly grateful for your time and attention in this regard, as I do not monetize this blog at all.

### Hobbies, Projects, and more errata

More to come, currently my hobby is revamping this website, which is also a quite a project!

### Contact me

...on Twitter or LinkedIn please, I'm still rewiring everything :)
